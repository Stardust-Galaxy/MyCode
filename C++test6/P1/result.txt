1) if remove the virtual in (1), the destruction function of B wouldn't be called

2) if remove the "const" in (6), compliation would be failed. Since the Func1() in B is a newly defined function, you can't initialize an Object of type B with a pointer with type A

3) Func2() use the default value in class A, but execute the function body in class B. The default value go with the static type of the Object

4) you can't change the "protected" at (4) to "private", because then it would be unaccessible for class B

5) No

6) initialize the static member in A

7) No

8) there will be compile time mistake. Since there won't be function body for func1'

9) Func3 is not a member of class A. No

10) Func1(int) is not a member of class A
